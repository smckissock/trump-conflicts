      "text": "While Trump repeatedly singled out Ford Motors for outsourcing American manufacturing jobs, according to Trump’s May 2016 Federal Election Commission filing, which provides a range of values for each of his stock holdings, he owns shares (worth up to $1 million) in the Detroit auto giant. Google, which Trump accused of suppressing negative Hillary Clinton news, is in his portfolio, as is Berkshire Hathaway, run by one of his fiercest critics, Warren Buffett. Though he tried to start a boycott against Apple AAPL +0.55% in February -- after the iPhone maker refused to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation break into one of the San Bernardino shooters’ phone -- Trump held onto his shares in the tech company, which were worth as much as $2 million in May."
