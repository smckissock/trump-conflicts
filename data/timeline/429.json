      "text": "The Donald J. Trump Foundation gave away $10.9 million from 2001 to 2014, taking a scattershot approach to philanthropy with donations to more than 400 different charities, according to a Forbes analysis of 14 years of IRS documents. Among the notable recipients: the William J. Clinton Foundation, a state branch of the ACLU and a nonprofit run by the New York Times, which Trump routinely criticizes on Twitter. Only $2.8 million of that money came from Trump himself."
