The deal was reportedly two years in the making. Yet in January 2017, Ivanka Trump&#39;s company reportedly reversed direction, &quot;after learning that Sanei&#39;s parent company had ties to the government of Japan,&quot; according to a May 17 letter from her company, IT Operations. Ivanka Trump took an official adviser position with the White House in March 2017; she had already resigned her positions from the company, though she retained ownership through a trust.",
