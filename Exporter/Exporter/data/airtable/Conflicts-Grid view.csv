The bank loaned him approximately $100 million in 2012 for Trump National Doral in South Florida, another $25 million to $50 million the same year for the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, and over $50 million in 2015 for the Old Post Office Hotel in Washington, D.C. Those transactions, as well as Trump’s failed attempt to purchase the Buffalo Bills football team in 2014, are under scrutiny by the New York Attorney General and Congressional investigators following Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s testimony that Trump over-stated his financial worth to establish a higher line of credit with the bank. New York State banking regulators also looked into Deutsche Bank in 2018, but took no action. "

Old Post Office Hotel,Active,113,"Prior to Donald Trump's official bid for the White House, the Trump Organization secured a 60-year lease with the U.S. government to renovate a historic post office in Washington, D.C., into a luxury, mixed-use development. The arrangement presents ongoing concerns now that Donald Trump is the U.S. government's chief executive. His position as both landlord and tenant opens opportunities for self-dealing that could prioritize his business interests over government efficiency. Additionally, foreign dignitaries and business representatives may book hotel stays and events as a means of currying favor with the president. A contractual clause designed to avoid such conflicts of interest prevents any elected official from sharing or benefiting from the lease. Because Trump did not divest of his business interest upon taking office, he may be violating the contract. However, his interests as either landlord and tenant would not be served by terminating the lease.

In 2018, Pres. Trump asked Panamanian President Juan Carlos Verala to intervene on his behalf in the wake of a high-profile scandal that devolved into a physical standoff when Trump business representatives refused to cede control of the property to investors attempting to fire them from their management role. Verala refused, and the scuffle ended with help from armed Panamanian authorities and a judicial ruling that ultimately ousted the Trump team from the property. (Under new management, the development was later renamed JW Marriott Panama.) But the conflict continues: In a 2018 lawsuit brought by the property's majority owner, the president's businesses stand accused of tax evasion, misrepresentation, financial mismanagement or misconduct, and improper destruction of records. A prior lawsuit was settled in 2016 for $75 million."
