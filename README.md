# trump-conflicts

This is a search tool based on the Sunlight Foundation's [Trump's Conflict of Interest](https://sunlightfoundation.com/tracking-trumps-conflicts-of-interest/) project. Based on this [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-_vJDLlCtd94zaieFeB2qdLB9WUdNPIryWBFNuXAAZ8/edit#gid=0)  

Ideas for improvement

- Show current filters about results listing
- Separate borders around search area (left) and results area (right)
- Add text searching for description and notes
- Scrape and index news stories and documents, and add search
- Replace pie chart filter for family members with photos of the 6
- Indicate category by color, or a check or X?
- Clearer way to show links to stories
- Trigger internet archive for links, add this link in addition to link to publisher sight
- Use publication logo for links
- Incorporate headline into links
- Incorporate a screenshot png into links
- Geocode by country at least, and map
- Rethink conflict/story relationship - "themes" or "news pegs" (tagging?)
- Allow for comments on conflicts or links?
- Scrape (or link to) comments on publication site? (e.g. Washington Post) Index? 
- Incorporate Sunlight content - e.g. "This Week in Conflicts"
